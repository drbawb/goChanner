Commonly used terms, and their meanings related to this project.
(Note, terms separated by commas are considered interchangeable)

*chan: refers to Futaba style imageboards that serve their content over HTTP.

board: refers to a category of postings. Boards are chosen by the owners of the *chan.

page: Each board has a fixed number of pages, each page carries a fixed number of threads.

thread,post: A thread is a collection of postings. Each thread has a fixed ID. Usually these IDs are autogenerated based on a unix timestamp and a 4 digit random integer, this is implementation specific though.

Each thread has a collection of replies.

reply: Essentially a thread, however unlike a thread which has no parent (aside from the board), each reply has a parent and is only visible from the context of that parent.

reply-tag: Most *chan software has a feature where it greps the body of a post/reply for an expression like:
   a) >>123456780
   or b) >>/board/123456780
 It then replaces that text with a hyperlink to that post.
 
 It is common for *chan users to use these reply-tags to mark that a section of the reply is directed at the post the tag points to.

trip,tripcode: Most *chan software allows the use of tripcodes. If the author elects to use a name, they may suffix it with "#<text>" or "##<text>".
The former is hashed, and a portion of the hash is shown along with the post. This hash serves to uniquely identify the poster, and as it is a one-way hash, it offers some protection against being stolen. (Because the hash is truncated to ~8 characters, it is trivial to bruteforce a key.)

The latter format is hashed with a server side salt (implementation specific.)
Since the salt is unknown in most cases, it's more difficult to bruteforce.

The public hash of a tripcode is shown in the format "Name!<Hash> or Name!!<Hash>"
